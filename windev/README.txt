This directory is to save the changes about psqlodbc driver under
win32 while the main development tree(the parent directory) is
nearly freezed(i.e. during beta, a while after the release until
the next branch is made etc). The changes would be reflected
to the main directory later after all. However note that the
trial binary version would be sometimes made using the source
and put on the ftp server for download.
