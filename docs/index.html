<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>psqlODBC</b> is the official PostgreSQL ODBC Driver.</p>
<p>The source code for this driver was originally adopted from version 0.20 of PostODBC. The
authors at that time were Christian Czezatke and Dan McGuirk.  Later it was maintained by Julie Ann Case.</p>

<p>As part of a commercial research project,
the developers at <a href="http://www.insightdist.com">Insight Distributions
System</a> overhauled the driver. Their goal was to make the driver
commercially viable. In keeping with the spirit with which
the original source was acquired, Insight published their work at this
location. Some time later and after some discussion with members
of the PostgreSQL organization, psqlODBC was adapted as the part of the
PostgreSQL source distribution. The driver continued to be maintained by 
Byron Nikolaidis, the developer at Insight who overhauled the driver for some time.</p>

<p>The driver is currently maintained by a number of contributors to the
PostgreSQL project. 
It is developed and supported through the 
<a href="http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-odbc/">pgsql-odbc@postgresql.org</a> mailing list.</p>

<p>psqlODBC is released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">Library General Public Licence</a>, or LGPL.</p>
