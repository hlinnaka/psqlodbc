<h1>Compiling psqlODBC on Windows</h1>

<p>
This page describes how to build the PostgreSQL ODBC Driver on Windows.  There
are two methods to build: from command line using nmake makefiles, from
command line using MSBuild files, and from Visual Studio IDE.
</p>

<p>
The following 3rd party software are required for the build:

<ul>
<li> Microsoft Windows SDK 7.0 (or later), or Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2005
     Edition (or later). Other compilers may work but have not been tested.
     Download the latest version from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/">Microsoft's download page</a>
</li>
<li> PostgreSQL Client library (libpq.dll) and headers. Download the latest
     version from the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/">
     PostgreSQL downloads page</a>. If you download the graphical installer,
     it is not necessary to install the server. You can pass
     "--extract-only yes" option to the installer to just extract the files
     without setting up the server.
</li>
<li> OpenSSL library and header files. Download the latest version from the
     <a href="https://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html">OpenSSL website</a>.
</li>
<li> WiX Toolset. Required for building the installer. Download the latest
     version from the <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WiX Toolset website</a>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
It's also possible to build without libpq and OpenSSL, but some authentication
methods will be disabled.
</p>

<h2>Building with MSBuild</h2>

Use MSBuild.exe to build the driver for the currently active target:<br><br>

    <code>C:\psqlodbc\&gt; MSBuild</code><br><br>

<p>
The default target performs a full build, which includes ANSI and Unicode
drivers, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, and also builds the installers.
The resulting drivers can be found in the x86_ANSI_Release and
x64_Unicode_Release directories, and the installers in x86_Release and
x64_Release directories (or *_Debug instead of *_Release, when building in Debug configuration).
</p>

<p>
Other targets are available for more fine-grained builds: BuildDriver,
BuildDriverBoth, BuildInstaller. See winbuild.proj for details.
</p>

<p>
By default, the drivers are built with libpq and SSPI support, and without
GSSAPI support. This is also the configuration used for the official binaries.
To build with other options, copy winbuild\configuration-defaults.props file
into winbuild\configuration-local.props, and edit the settings. The
configuration-local.props file can also be used to specify non-standard
locations for PostgreSQL and OpenSSL headers and libraries.
