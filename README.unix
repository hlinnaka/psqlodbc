psqlODBC README for *nix Systems
================================

Since psqlODBC has be moved from the main PostgreSQL source tree, we have yet
to create a new build system for the driver. Currently, in order to build under
*nix systems, it is recommended that you copy the files in this directory to
src/interfaces/odbc in your PostgreSQL source tree, then re-run configure with
the required options from the top of the tree. The driver can then be built
using make as per normal.
